    The challenge is to insert a new card into the list, preserving the order from most of the given color on top to least on the bottom (eg most red to least red).
</p>
    If you believe a previous player made a mistake, you can choose to doubt the list ordering. If the list is not in order from most to least of the color, you get the point. If it is in order, the player who went on the previous turn gets the point.
<p>
    If you don't choose to doubt, it's your turn to insert a card to the list.
</p>

<p>
    The first player to 3 points wins.
